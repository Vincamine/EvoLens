# EvoLens

Overview

This project presents a hybrid data pipeline designed to integrate data repair, anomaly detection, pattern characterization, and predictive modeling. Built using Python, Perl, and R, the system leverages algorithms and deep learning models to ensure data integrity, consistency, and insightful analysis.

🚀 Pipeline Workflow

Step 1: Data Ingestion & Cleaning

✔ Extracts raw data from structured/unstructured sources.
✔ Applies automated repair techniques for missing or inconsistent data.

Step 2: Anomaly Detection

✔ Uses unsupervised learning (e.g., Isolation Forest) to detect outliers.
✔ Implements statistical methods for early warning signals.

Step 3: Pattern Characterization

✔ Identifies structural patterns using time-series analysis & clustering.
✔ Evaluates correlations for feature selection.

Step 4: Predictive Modeling

✔ Deploys deep learning models (LSTM, transformers) for trend forecasting.
✔ Implements probabilistic models for decision support.
